Our system aims to solve the problem of decision making in an ice cream shop. 
We will have a catalog consisting of various flavors that our users can choose from along with varying toppings, 
serving sizes, and additional desserts. The user can choose whether they want a cone or a cup using the set up inputs
and we will have default promotions and options that the user can use as a template if they can't decide or just simply want ice
cream.
